#Q13
Using the already defined RBF SVC model `m`, run a grid search on the parameters C and gamma, for values [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]. The grid search should find the model that best optimizes for recall. How much better is the recall of this model than the precision? (Compute recall - precision to 3 decimal places)

(Use y_test and X_test to compute precision and recall.)

print(m)
grid_values = {'C':[0.01, 0.1, 1, 10],'gamma': [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]}

grid_clf_recall = GridSearchCV(m, param_grid = grid_values, scoring = 'recall')
grid_clf_recall.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = grid_clf_recall.predict(X_test)

print('Grid best gamma: ', grid_clf_recall.best_params_)
print('Grid best score (recall): ', grid_clf_recall.best_score_)
print(precision_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(recall_score(y_test,y_pred)-precision_score(y_test, y_pred))
